ecCodes-GRIB
============

Python interface to read and write GRIB files via the ECMWF ecCodes C library.

The project targets Python 3, but aims to retain Python 2 compatibility as long as
possible.

.. important::
    The API is not compatible and it is not intended to be compatible with ecCodes python bindings.
